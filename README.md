# Sankey-Diagram
This project focuses on visualizing the progression of patient conditions through Sankey diagrams, which are effective for displaying multiple flows and how they intertwine across stages. The script processes patient data to map transitions between various medical conditions and treatments, highlighting the pathways commonly followed and their frequencies.
This tool is particularly useful for healthcare data analysts and medical researchers looking to improve patient care strategies and understand treatment effectiveness across various conditions.
